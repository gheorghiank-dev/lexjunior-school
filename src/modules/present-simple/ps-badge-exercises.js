export const badgeStoryTtsText = "Every day in my family starts differently for each of us. I have my own routine, and my brother has his, and they almost never look the same. That’s why our daily schedules feel like two separate little stories. I usually wake up at 7 a.m., and the first thing I do is make a quick cup of coffee. I check my messages, then I start preparing for school. I always leave the house around 7:45 because I like to walk slowly and enjoy the quiet morning. During the day, I study , teach, and work on different projects. In the afternoon, I often meet my friends or read something relaxing. I usually get home around 6 p.m., cook something simple, and finish my homework or plan lessons for the next day. My brother, on the other hand, gets up much later. He normally checks the news, makes a big breakfast, and sits at his computer around 10. He spends most of the afternoon gaming or working on tech projects. In the evening, he sometimes goes out with friends or orders food online because he hates cooking. He usually works from home and goes to bed after midnight, while I’m already asleep. Even though our days are different, we still find time to talk, laugh, and share small moments. And maybe that’s what really matters in a family.";
